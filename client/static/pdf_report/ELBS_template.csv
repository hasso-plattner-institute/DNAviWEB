6.2	Cell-free DNA isolation	Technical aspects – cfDNA sample	info	Extraction Kit (DNA Isolation Method),DNA Mass,DNA Mass Units	FALSE
6.3	Cell-free DNA QC	Technical aspects – cfDNA sample	info	"DNA profile:plots/all_samples.pdf,DNA clustering:plots/cluster_by_sample.pdf,Detection of high molecular weight DNA (Potential source ecDNA, gDNA or orther):stats/peak_statistics.csv
"	FALSE
6.4	Any sample QC not meeting criteria?	Technical aspects – cfDNA sample	bool	FALSE	FALSE
7	Downstream Test QC	Technical aspects – downstream test	info	"Type of planned downstream assay,LOD (limit of detection),LOB (limit of blank),LOQ (limit of quantiﬁcation)
"	FALSE
7.1	Downstream Test Specifics	Technical aspects – downstream test	info	"analytical sensitivity,analytical speciﬁcity,Sequencing: percentage of target region covered with the minimum required depth,Sequencing: average sequencing depth
"	FALSE
7.2	Any downstream QC not meeting criteria?	Technical aspects – downstream test	bool	FALSE	FALSE
8	Variant QC	Technical aspects – downstream test	info	Recommendation for equivocal variants	1. This report excludes variants with variant allele fraction (VAF) below or equal to the LOB. 2. Variants with VAF between LOB and LOD will be labeled ‘equivocal’ – their presence is uncertain
8.1	Variant Report	Downstream test results	info	"Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (incl. number of supporting reads, sequencing depth, VAF, number of mutated molecules, conﬁdence level),Variants in cancer susceptibility genes with VAF indicating germline origin (incl. number of supporting reads, sequencing depth, VAF, number of mutated molecules, conﬁdence level),Potential CH-related variants  (incl. number of supporting reads, sequencing depth, VAF, number of mutated molecules, conﬁdence level)
"	FALSE
8.2	Recommendation for putative germline variants	Downstream test results	info	FALSE	FALSE
8.3	SCNA & fusions	Downstream test results	info	SCNA (estimated copy number or log2 ratio, conﬁdence level, potentially co-ampliﬁed genes and estimated size of the ampliﬁed/deleted segment)	LOD for SCNA and fusions may be lower compared to SNVs/indels, detection requires a higher tumor fraction.
8.4	Negative results ( Tumor fraction – Not detected or Requested mutation is not detected)	Downstream test results	neg	Negative results ( Tumor fraction – Not detected or Requested mutation not detected)	The presence of mutations below the LOD cannot be excluded.
9	Unexpected findings	Unexpected findings	bool	Explanation why the ﬁndings were unexpected	Referral to a Molecular Tumor Board for discussion may be desirable upon unexpected findings.
10	Clinically actionable results and evidence-based associations with response to speciﬁc drugs	Actionability	info	Clinically actionable results and evidence-based associations with response to speciﬁc drugs	The actual clinical annotation for matching a treatment to a speciﬁc variant for each individual patients should only be done by the treating physician or a Molecular Tumor Board (MTB).
